# Library Webiste

Testing [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/home) as CMS for the new library website. This is because Sitefinity seems to be very restricted, and it's only for webpages, or listing publications at best.

## Docker 

Installed [Docker Desktop][desktop] to test the hosting of the IT department.

## Drupal

Using the example of `docker compose` for installing Docker with MySQL.

During the configuration, the database hostname is _db_ not _localhost_ in the _advanced_ options.
